          <h3 class="headers">Unreal Engine</h3>

          <strong> Unreal Engine</strong> is a free* to use software to create
          almost anything you can image: from virtual worlds to the visually
          stunning games. There are tones of resources where to start to learn
          unreal engine but I think the best way, and many will be agreed with
          me, is the YouTube video from
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UnrealSensei" class="line-link"
            >Unreal Sensei.</a
          >
          He has not just one but two (or maybe even three) videos 5 HOURS each!
          And you know what even more insane about it, it is absolutely free.
          But please do not afraid this amount of time. It is more than just
          worth it. And
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-zMkzmduqI&ab_channel=UnrealSensei"
            class="line-link"
            >this</a
          >
          is where you want to kickstart your <em>Unreal Journey</em>.

          <br /><br />

          If you are interested in creating small movies with landscapes, the
          next step (after you've finished the Sensei's Tutorial) will be this
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@magnetvfx" class="line-link"
            >small channel</a
          >
          from a very talented and hard-working guy, Amit.

          <br /><br />

          And we cannot talk about Unreal Engine without mentioning this guy.
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WilliamFaucher" class="line-link">
            William Faucher</a
          >. His works are fantastic. So high quality. He has also a lot of
          stuff on Epic Games Marketplace. Check it out and give this guy a big
          love he deserves.

          <h3 class="headers">Web Dev</h3>

          <strong> Web Development</strong> is right now one of the most
          demandable skill to acquire and one of the <em>cheapest</em> one. By
          that I mean, you can start to learn and develop your skills without
          spending none a single cent on lessons (excluding your internet costs
          and laptop or pc purchase). Because web dev has such a compassionate
          and kind community, who share their high quality knowledge for free,
          to make web accessible for all and a better place to be! Please keep
          that in mind, when you next time write your own website.

          <br /><br />

          Everything starts with and IDE (Integrated Development Environment). A
          smart word for a simple and at the same time complex "Editor". In our
          case, Code Editor. As always, there are some awesome editors, and with
          the time goes by, you'll develop your own preferences but start with
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" class="line-link"
            >Visual Studio Code</a
          >. You'll love with its endless list of extensions, which makes our
          code adventures much easier and faster and much much more...

          <br /><br />

          I could throw a hundreds of links, where to start learning web dev but
          a good point to start for me (and probably it will be for you) was the
          wonderful book of
          <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/" class="line-link">Shay Howe</a>.
          He has wrote two of them, one for beginners and one for more advanced
          topics. I found his work very informative, entertainment and it covers
          each aspect of web dev. More than just that, he has so many references
          on pages of hes books, to dig even deeper, if you want. Ah yes, I was
          very impressed and found it useful. So give it a try to kickstart your
          web dev career. I've bought his book, even though, he has shared his
          knowledge for free. Just to be nice.

          <br /><br />

          And also don't forget to look at this sensational documentation from
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" class="line-link"
            >Mozilla</a
          >
          and refer to it, if you have any questions.

          <br /><br />

          In fact if you want to have my web dev
          <strong>bookmarks</strong> and a list with my visual studio code
          <strong> extensions</strong>, where I have more than 50 useful pages
          and about 35 extensions, submit your email address in the form below
          with a nice message, and I will send it over to you. For free of
          course. Don't worry, I will not spam your mailbox. My web dev
          bookmarks have a lot of links to the free to use resources with most
          of the tools for almost any problem you would face. Even if you don't
          know for what is particular link could be useful, still get it to you.
          You'll thanks me later.
