          <strong> Unreal Engine</strong> is an amazing software that allows you
          to create virtual worlds and visually stunning games. There are plenty
          of resources available to help you learn, but one of the best ways is
          to watch the YouTube videos from
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UnrealSensei" class="line-link"

          <h3 class="headers">Web Dev</h3>

          <strong>Web Development</strong> is currently one of the most
          sought-after skills to acquire, and it's also one of the most
          affordable. What I mean by that is you can start learning and honing
          your skills without spending a single penny on lessons (excluding your
          internet costs and the purchase of a laptop or PC). The web
          development community is incredibly compassionate and kind, and they
          freely share their high-quality knowledge to make the web accessible
          for everyone and create a better online environment. So, keep this in
          mind when you're working on your own website next time.

          <br /><br />

          Everything begins with an IDE (Integrated Development Environment),
          which is just a fancy term for a simple yet complex "Editor." In our
          case, it's a Code Editor. There are plenty of amazing editors out
          there, and as time goes by, you'll develop your own preferences. But I
          recommend starting with
          <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" class="line-link"
            >Visual Studio Code</a
          >. You'll fall in love with its extensive list of extensions, which
          make coding adventures much easier, faster, and more enjoyable.

          <br /><br />

          I could provide you with hundreds of links to start learning web
          development, but a great starting point for me (and probably for you
          too) was
          <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/" class="line-link"
            >Shay Howe's</a
          >
          wonderful book. He has written two books, one for beginners and
          another for more advanced topics. I found his work to be highly
          informative, entertaining, and comprehensive, covering every aspect of
          web development. What's even better is that he includes numerous
          references throughout his books, allowing you to delve even deeper if
          you wish. I was truly impressed and found it incredibly useful. So,
          give it a try to kickstart your web development career. I actually
          purchased his book, even though he generously shared his knowledge for
          free, just to show my appreciation.

          <br /><br />

          You might also want to check out the fantastic documentation from
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" class="line-link"
            >Mozilla</a
          >. It's an invaluable resource that you can refer to whenever you have
          any questions.

          <br /><br />

          In fact, if you'd like to have access to my
          <strong>web development bookmarks</strong> and a list of my
          <strong>Visual Studio Code extensions</strong> (which includes over 50
          useful pages and about 35 extensions), simply submit your email
          address in the form below along with a nice message, and I'll send it
          over to you. And of course, it's completely free. Don't worry, I won't
          spam your mailbox. My web development bookmarks contain a wealth of
          information that can greatly assist you in your journey. You'll
          definitely thank me later for that.
